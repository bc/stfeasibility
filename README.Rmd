The goal of stfeasibility is to evaluate, for a given force trajectory, for a static tendon-driven limb, the feasible combinations of time-varying muscle activation patterns.

## Installation

You can install stfeasibility from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bc/stfeasibility")
```

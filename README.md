Spatiotemporal Feasibility Theory

full task is 2 seconds
A matrix doesn't change

Tasks: [palmar force, and distal force scaling task, arc line from palmar to distal]
Conditions: [degenerate case, velocity constrained]

Evaluations:
	compute: linsolve for the optimal l2 activation trajectory
	compute: linsolve for the minimum change in activation
	compute: generate 10k activation trajectories
		for each activation trajectory, calculate the maximum velocity incurred
			make cumulative distribution. x axis is max velocity for activation trajectory
		show distribution of bottom 1% l2 activation trajectory from
comparisons: 
	compare 10k from degenerate vs velocity-constrained to get the % remaining solutions.

nice to haves but definitely put in discussion
1. Acceptance of error, a cube around each point being all valid output wrenches
2. conditions += Acceleration Constraint
